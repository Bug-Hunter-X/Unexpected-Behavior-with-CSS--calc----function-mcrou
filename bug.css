The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a flexbox container might not produce the expected result if the 10px is not relative to the container's dimensions.

Another example is that units must match. For example, mixing percentages and pixels directly is invalid in `calc()` such as `width: calc(100% + 10px)` or `height: calc(50% - 1em)`
