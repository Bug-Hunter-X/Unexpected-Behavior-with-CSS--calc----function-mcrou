# Unexpected Behavior with CSS `calc()` Function

This repository demonstrates some uncommon issues that can arise when using the `calc()` function in CSS. The `calc()` function is powerful, but its usage requires attention to detail, particularly regarding unit consistency and the context in which calculations are performed.

## Issues:

* **Unit Mismatch:**  Mixing incompatible units directly within `calc()` leads to errors and unexpected behavior.
* **Contextual Calculations:** The value of `calc()` can be unexpected depending on the element's context within the page layout (e.g. flexbox).

## Solutions:

* **Consistent Units:** Always use compatible units within a single `calc()` expression (e.g., `calc(100% - 20px)`). If necessary, use intermediate variables or separate calculations to handle different unit types.
* **Context Awareness:** Understand the context in which `calc()` is used. If calculations appear inconsistent, examine the parent element and its layout properties.
